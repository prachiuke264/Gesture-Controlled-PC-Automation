Overview:
This project is a real-time hand gesture based PC automation system built using Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence. The system detects hand gestures through webcam using MediaPipe and performs different PC actions such as opening applications, system control and automation.
The project includes a safety hold-to-confirm mechanism, on-screen menu navigation and fullscreen visual feedback for a smooth and secure user experience.

Features:
Real-time hand gesture detection using MediaPipe
PC automation (open apps, system actions, navigation)
Hold-to-confirm safety mechanism (prevents accidental triggers)
On-screen menu system for mode selection
Fullscreen animated visual feedback (Huawei-style ring)
Works completely offline (no internet required)
Lightweight and fast real-time performance

Technologies Used:
Python
OpenCV
MediaPipe
NumPy
Computer Vision
Automation

How It Works:
Webcam captures hand gestures
MediaPipe detects hand landmarks
Gesture is converted into action
Hold mechanism confirms execution
System performs automation action

Installation:
pip install -r requirements.txt
